# PostgreSQL Docker Setup Fixes

I've made several changes to fix the PostgreSQL configuration:

1. **Updated Dockerfile**: The Dockerfile was updated to include PostgreSQL support:
   - Added `libpq-dev` to the system dependencies
   - Added `pdo_pgsql` PHP extension installation

2. **Fixed Docker Container**: The current running container has the PostgreSQL PHP extension installed manually.

3. **Environment Configuration**: Created a PostgreSQL-compatible environment in `.env`

4. **Docker Compose**: Updated the docker-compose.yml to include a properly configured PostgreSQL service.

## Next Steps

To ensure these changes are permanent:

1. **Rebuild your Docker Images**:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

2. If you need to switch between MySQL and PostgreSQL:
   - Update the `DB_CONNECTION` value in your `.env` file (`mysql` or `pgsql`)
   - Make sure your application code is compatible with both database systems (e.g., avoid MySQL-specific SQL)

## Cursor IDE Configuration

The PHP validation in Cursor is now configured to use the Docker container, which has PostgreSQL support installed. This ensures that your IDE will correctly validate your code when working with PostgreSQL.

**Remember**: If you make changes to your Dockerfile (e.g., adding new extensions), you'll need to rebuild your containers for those changes to take effect.
